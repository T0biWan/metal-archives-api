# metal-archives-api

This is a learning excercise to communicate with APIs through python.
I used the unofficial [JSON API for Encyclopedia Metallum](http://em.wemakesites.net/), which retrieves data from [Encyclopaedia Metallum](https://www.metal-archives.com/)

To use the scripts yourself, get yourself an [API key](http://em.wemakesites.net/#/get-api-key) and add a file called _api_token.txt_ where you past in your key.

Also you want to install [_requests_](https://github.com/requests/requests) via pip in an virtual environment like _venv_.
